# Risk-Prediction-in-Supply-Chain-Orders

This is a Supply Chain dataset related to MakeUp domain.

You can find this dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis This dataset has the following parameters (each with 100 values): Product Type (Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics), SKU, Price, Availability, Number of products sold, Revenue generated, Customer demographics, Stock levels, Lead times, Order quantities, Shipping times, Shipping carriers, Shipping costs, Supplier name, Location, Lead time, Production volumes, Manufacturing lead time, Manufacturing costs, Inspection results, Defect rates, Transportation modes, Routes, Costs

For this project, I analyzed a supply chain dataset containing SKU-level information such as sales velocity, availability, reorder point, EOQ, and supplier indicators. My objective was to build a classification model that accurately predicts whether a product is at risk of stockout. This project piqued my interest because of its relevance to real-world inventory optimization and its alignment with my goal of uncovering actionable insights through machine learning. I began by performing feature engineering — calculating risk scores and EOQ deviations — and then trained a binary classifier using supervised learning techniques. After experimenting with several models, I selected the one that consistently yielded high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across cross-validation folds. The final model achieved perfect scores (1.00) in all major evaluation categories including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, even when applied to imbalanced classes. To validate robustness, I conducted hyperparameter tuning and used classification reports and confusion matrices to confirm that the model correctly identified both high-risk and low-risk SKUs. The project was developed using Python, Streamlit for visualization, and Plotly for interactive charts. Challenges included dealing with missing data and inconsistent column naming, which I overcame by implementing dynamic feature validation and column cleanup logic. All code and results were documented and shared in the assignment section, accompanied by an interactive dashboard for visual interpretation. The implications of the model are significant — enabling proactive inventory decisions and improving supply chain resilience.
